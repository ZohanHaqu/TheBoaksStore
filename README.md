The Boaks Store is a new app marketplace for both Android and Windows platforms. As a beta version, the store is currently limited, allowing users to install only 4 apps at a time. Until February 20th, the store will gradually introduce a total of 50 apps, but users are advised to temper their expectations due to the barebones functionality.

The Boaks Store's design is minimalistic, with a plain gray background and no fun or engaging user interface. Unlike other app stores, which allow for seamless installation, Boaks Store requires the use of the winget tool for installing apps. While this may appeal to users who prefer command-line tools, it can be a cumbersome experience compared to more user-friendly alternatives.

Upcoming Features:

February 20th: 50 apps will be available for installation.
May 26th: Linux support will be introduced.
Despite its rough edges, the Boaks Store aims to provide a unique experience, albeit one that's currently very technical and basic. If you're comfortable with a minimal approach and command-line installations, it could be an interesting option, but expect more functionality and polish as the store matures.
